#Considered Assumptions 

My first impression upon reading the instuctions(outline) README.md was ...
Oh cool, Docker, Oh AngularJS(a tech I am yet to build with)
#I am now familar with AngularJS
Initialy I was planning to use node and express modules, some body popping, sorry body parsing ;)
Being more familiar with Node I would use Node to serve the AngularJS front-end.

I started with this approach, soon I realised it was going to be a bit verbose for this task(I could be wrong PLEASE FeedBack! on this)

#Considered approach

• Use Angular JS  
# Bring it and manage data(JSON)
• considering .map() & .filter()
# Filter data
• consideeing JavaScript switch Statement over condictional, Angular filter/map option
# Styling
• Sass or Material/Bootstrap 

  




#Earliest Initial impression

•Server needed
•possible store required
•possible restruture some requests
•test API's
•Styling needed

1 run in Docker
    as server 
    use a test env
*** did not get site to run in Dock env 
    

2 build out site
    * Node
    * Express
    * MongoDB


*Jasmin investigate ***

    *MongoDB ...(Is this a bit much?!)
